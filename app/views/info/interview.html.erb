  <p>Hi everyone! I am Gianna, an UCI college student investigating redesigning the website. I am conducting interviews and surveys on users’ experience with the MO website. It would be very helpful in making MO even better if you could fill out the following 5–10 minute survey:</p>

  <p class="indent"><a href="https://forms.gle/dRix5MzBw8ZSJQZt6">https://forms.gle/dRix5MzBw8ZSJQZt6</a></p>

  <p>If you would like to participate in a 20–30 minute interview or testing the website, please fill out this form and I will get back to you within a few days:</p>

  <p class="indent"><a href="https://forms.gle/on8Hx6e6pkrAg4jt9">https://forms.gle/on8Hx6e6pkrAg4jt9</a></p>

  <p>Participants have the option to be entered into a raffle for an online $20 gift card to be sent to the winner’s email by August 2nd. Participating in the survey will award one raffle entry. Interview, or website testing will result in three raffle entires each. The data collected will be confidential, any identifying information such email will not be associated with your responses.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your help! If you have any questions, please email me at:<p>
